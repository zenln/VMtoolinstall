# Purpose
The purpose of this script is for machines to install respective vm tools. I mean to call this script from the kickstart file to install respective vm tools for where the machine is installed.

# Note
- Please be sure to have the channels containing the VM Tool package in your channel.
- I mainly use RHEV or similar variant of linux in my work env. If you are using DNF it is pretty interchangeable at this point.

# Addition:
- Add more hypervisors in.
- May be add different flavours for linux
